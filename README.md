# Abusive Text Detection : From Traditional Machine Learning to Deep Learning Approaches

For detecting abusive Twitter content, an existing dataset is identified and examined several algorithms based on machine learning and deep learning, such as Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (Logit) Classifier, Multinomial Na¨ıve Bayes (MNB), Random Forest (RF), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) . Also performing parameter tuning to increase the performance of the algorithms and measured recall, precision, and f1-score of different classifiers as well. Experimental results showed that GRU worked with the best performance in the single-directional mode using the GloVe (glove-twitter-200) embedding with the highest accuracy of 95.26%.
